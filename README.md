# Jon's Jumping Square Game

## Official First Website of Jonathan Rubio

Having completed three and a half years at Golden State Baptist College, Jonathan Rubio is about to complete his college career. Jonathan loves to sing. He will be travelling around the country from May to July as part of the Golden Avenue Quartet, singing songs about the Lord, and recruiting the next generation of Bible scholars. 

Here are a few interesting websites that inspire Jonathan in his endeavour to learn computer coding:
1. https://www.phonearena.com/news/Let-Steve-the-dinosaur-jump-all-over-your-apps-and-notifications-in-your-new-favorite-widget-game_id81645
2. https://superbwebsitebuilders.com/make-a-gaming-website/
3. https://gamepress.gg/pokemongo/

My goal for this semester is to learn as much as I can about computer coding, so that I may create a game where a square jumps over spikes. To complete my task, I will study css, html, and javascript.
Timelines are exciting to create because creat events worth looking forward to. Jonathan will study html for an hour every week. He will study
css for an hour every week and he will study javascript for an hour every week.
